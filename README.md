# The Hero Path

> We have not even to risk the adventure alone  
> for the heroes of all time have gone before us.  
> The labyrinth is thoroughly known...  
> we have only to follow the thread of the hero path.  
> And where we had thought to find an abomination  
> we shall find a God.  
>  
> And where we had thought to slay another  
> we shall slay ourselves.  
> Where we had thought to travel outwards  
> we shall come to the center of our own existence.  
> And where we had thought to be alone  
> we shall be with all the world.  
>  
> -Joseph Campbell
